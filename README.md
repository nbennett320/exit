## 0. Preamble
One of the finest truths of the world is that there is no one true method to accomplish a given task. Perhaps no class of people know this truth better than programmers, who dedicate their lives to finding provacative and innovative ways to solve problems. By our nature, we are not pleased with finding the simple, "cookie cutter" way to reach our goal. To quench our thirst, we must devise an intricate approach to reach our destination. 

Exiting a terminal is a something every programmer has done thousands of times. Thousands of times, a programmer exits a terminal by clicking on the 'x' in the top right corner. This method of exiting is tried and true, battle tested, but makes for a path that has been beaten down to nothing. Fewer programmers exit their terminal session by running the shell command exit. We have decided neither of these methods are sufficient. We have decided to pave our own path, by writing our own shell script to exit a terminal session. This is the story of Exit.[]()sh.

## 1. History
The Bourne-again Shell (Bash) is a command line interpreter and language written by American computer scientist Brian Fox. The shell was designed to be a free-software alternative to the Bourne shell. Bash was initially made for the GNU Project in 1989, but is still used today as the default login shell for most Linux and MacOs distrobutions.

The Bash language syntax is a superset of the Bourne shell which it successfully replaced; Bash inherits brace expansion, command line completion, debugging, and a variety of other expressions &#8211; one of which is `exit` keyword, which indicates the termination of a program. Keyword `exit`'s output reflects the exit status of an executed command. Exit status's range from 0 to 255 and will be discussed in the [implementation section](#implementation)

## 2. Introduction
Our approach to Exit.[]()sh aims to mesh elegance and functionality by creating a succinct script to overcome the aforementioned burden that is the 'x' button. This goal is certainly ambitious, and achieving it was no simple feat. 

Another factor which influenced this script's implementation is legibility. It was Linus Torvalds &#8211; pioneer of the world-renowned Linux kernel &#8211; who [said](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1372161): 
> UNIX has a philosophy, it has 25 years of history behind it, and most importantly, it has a clean core. It strives for something - some kind of beauty. <br /> - Linus Torvalds

It is an unfortunate truth that many programmers sacrifice legibility for quick or easy application. However as programmers we must strive for legibility, for it is the most tangible and human aspect of coding as an art itself. To write legible code is to preserve this work of art, therefore empowering other developers to create works of their own through style, grace, and transparency.

An obsessive focus on these principles combined with our core objectives rendered an extremely daunting task. Countless hours were spent ruminating over a myriad of different implementations.

## 3. Implementation
According to the [Bash official documentation](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html), the [exit status](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Exit-Status) of a command is the value returned by the _waitpid_ system call or equivalent functions. Under certain circumstances, the shell will use special values to indicate specific failure modes.

For the shellâ€™s purposes, a command which exits with a zero exit status has succeeded. A non-zero exit status indicates failure. This seemingly counter-intuitive scheme is used so there is one well-defined way to indicate success and a variety of ways to indicate various failure modes. When a command terminates on a fatal signal whose number is _N_, Bash returns an exit status 128+_N_.

[Parameters](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Shell-Parameters) can be passed to Bash scripts in the command line interface. Arguments are accessed inside a script with the _$_ symbol and the argument's respective index.

Our initial implementation, or first official version, of Exit.[]()sh took user arguments. While the exact original implementation was lost in a sea of notes, test scripts, and early concepts, the first official script likely looked something like this:

```
exit $1
```

Despite this implementation's bloated or otherwise needlessly complex nature, it permits users to pass their preferred exit status as an argument. For example, a user might want to terminate Exit.[]()sh with exit code _1_ as opposed to _0_. In practice this would look like:

```
user@user:~/$ sh exit.sh 1
```

User arguments do allow for more flexibility on the user's behalf, as there are simply more possible exit statuses. However we opted to take a more streamlined approach, which is only allowing the script to execute with exit code _0_. This logic behind this decision will be elaborated on in the [discussion section](#discussion)
